A simple app built in react, that describes the weather in its current location.

To get the current location, the app uses [react-use-geolocation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-geolocation).

To get the weather right for the current location, the app uses the [freeCodeCamp Weather API](https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/).
